# Pizza Scheduling Project

## Overview
This project implements a pizza scheduling system using POSIX threads (`pthread`) in C. The system manages pizza orders, schedules the preparation, and handles delivery using multi-threading to optimize performance.

## Features
- Multi-threaded order handling
- Pizza preparation and baking simulation
- Delivery scheduling
- Thread synchronization using mutexes and condition variables

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- POSIX thread library
- Unix based OS

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThanosDim1/PizzaDelivery.git
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -pthread -o p3220039-p3220105-pizza.c

## Usage 
./a.out 10 100     
_The first variable is the seed and the second the number of customers_

## File Structure
-p3220039-p3220105-pizza.c: Main source file containing the implementation         
-p3220039-p3220105-pizza.h: Header file with function declarations and data structures
